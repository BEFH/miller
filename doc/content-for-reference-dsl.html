</td> </tr>
</table>

<p/>Please see <a href="reference-verbs.html">here</a> for information on
verbs other than <code>put</code> and <code>filter</code>.

<p/>
The essential usages of <code>mlr filter</code> and <code>mlr put</code> are for
record-selection and record-updating expressions, respectively. For example, given the following input data:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/small}}HERE

<p/> you might retain only the records whose <code>a</code> field has value <code>eks</code>:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr filter '$a == "eks"' data/small}}HERE

<p/> or you might add a new field which is a function of existing fields:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$ab = $a . "_" . $b ' data/small}}HERE

<p/>The two verbs <code>mlr filter</code> and <code>mlr put</code> are essentially the
same. The only differences are:

<ul>

<li/> Expressions sent to <code>mlr filter</code> must end with a boolean expression,
which is the filtering criterion;

<li/> <code>mlr filter</code> expressions may not
reference the <code>filter</code> keyword within them; and

<li/> <code>mlr filter</code> expressions may not use <code>tee</code>, <code>emit</code>,
<code>emitp</code>, or <code>emitf</code>.

</ul>

<p/> All the rest is the same: in particular, you can define and invoke
functions and subroutines to help produce the final boolean statement, and
record fields may be assigned to in the statements preceding the final boolean
statement.

<p/>There are more details and more choices, of course, as detailed in the following sections.

<h1>Syntax</h1>
<button style="font-weight:bold;color:maroon;border:0" padding=0 onclick="vis_toggle_by_name('body_section_toggle_syntax');" href="javascript:;">Toggle section visibility</button>
<div id="body_section_toggle_syntax" style="display: block">

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Expression formatting</h2>

<p/>Multiple expressions may be given, separated by semicolons, and each may refer to the ones before:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{ruby -e '10.times{|i|puts "i=#{i}"}' | mlr --opprint put '$j = $i + 1; $k = $i +$j'}}HERE

Newlines within the expression are ignored, which can help increase legibility of complex expressions:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/put-multiline-example.txt)HERE

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --opprint filter '($x > 0.5 && $y < 0.5) || ($x < 0.5 && $y > 0.5)' then stats2 -a corr -f x,y data/medium}}HERE

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Expressions from files</h2>

<p/>The simplest way to enter expressions for <code>put</code> and <code>filter</code> is between single quotes on the command line, e.g.

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/fe-example-1.sh)HERE
POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/fe-example-2.sh)HERE

<p/>You may, though, find it convenient to put expressions into files for reuse, and read them
<b>using the -f option</b>. For example:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/fe-example-3.mlr}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --from data/small put -f data/fe-example-3.mlr}}HERE

<p/>If you have some of the logic in a file and you want to write the rest on the command line, you
can <b>use the -f and -e options together</b>:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/fe-example-4.mlr}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --from data/small put -f data/fe-example-4.mlr -e '$xy = f($x, $y)'}}HERE

<p/>A suggested use-case here is defining functions in files, and calling them from command-line expressions.

<p/>Another suggested use-case is putting default parameter values in files, e.g. using
<code>begin{@count=is_present(@count)?@count:10}</code> in the file, where you can precede that using
<code>begin{@count=40}</code> using <code>-e</code>.

<p/>Moreover, you can have one or more <code>-f</code> expressions (maybe one
function per file, for example) and one or more <code>-e</code> expressions on the
command line.  If you mix <code>-f</code> and <code>-e</code> then the expressions are
evaluated in the order encountered. (Since the expressions are all simply
concatenated together in order, don&rsquo;t forget intervening semicolons: e.g.
not <code>mlr put -e '$x=1' -e '$y=2 ...'</code> but rather <code>mlr put -e '$x=1;' -e
'$y=2' ...</code>.)

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Semicolons, commas, newlines, and curly braces</h2>

<p/>Miller uses <b>semicolons as statement separators</b>, not statement terminators. This means you can write:

POKI_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/semicolon-example.txt)HERE

<p/>Semicolons are optional after closing curly braces (which close conditionals and loops as discussed below).

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{echo x=1,y=2 | mlr put 'while (NF < 10) { $[NF+1] = ""}  $foo = "bar"'}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{echo x=1,y=2 | mlr put 'while (NF < 10) { $[NF+1] = ""}; $foo = "bar"'}}HERE

<p/>Semicolons are required between statements even if those statements are on
separate lines.  <b>Newlines</b> are for your convenience but have no syntactic
meaning: line endings do not terminate statements. For example, adjacent
assignment statements must be separated by semicolons even if those statements
are on separate lines:

POKI_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/newline-example.txt)HERE

<p/><b>Trailing commas</b> are allowed in function/subroutine definitions,
function/subroutine callsites, and map literals. This is intended for (although
not restricted to) the multi-line case:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/trailing-commas.sh)HERE

<p/>Bodies for all compound statements must be enclosed in <b>curly braces</b>, even if the body is a single statement:
POKI_CARDIFY{{mlr put 'if ($x == 1) $y = 2' # Syntax error}}HERE
POKI_CARDIFY{{mlr put 'if ($x == 1) { $y = 2 }' # This is OK}}HERE

<p/>Bodies for compound statements may be empty:

POKI_CARDIFY{{mlr put 'if ($x == 1) { }' # This no-op is syntactically acceptable}}HERE

</div>

<h1>Variables</h1>
<button style="font-weight:bold;color:maroon;border:0" padding=0 onclick="vis_toggle_by_name('body_section_toggle_variables');" href="javascript:;">Toggle section visibility</button>
<div id="body_section_toggle_variables" style="display: block">

<p/>Miller has the following kinds of variables:

<p/> <b>Built-in variables</b> such as <code>NF</code>, <code>NF</code>,
<code>FILENAME</code>, <code>M_PI</code>, and <code>M_E</code>.  These are all capital letters
and are read-only (although some of them change value from one record to
another).

<p/> <b>Fields of stream records</b>, accessed using the <code>$</code> prefix.
These refer to fields of the current data-stream record. For example, in
<code>echo x=1,y=2 | mlr put '$z = $x + $y'</code>, <code>$x</code> and <code>$y</code>
refer to input fields, and <code>$z</code> refers to a new, computed output field.
In a few contexts, presented below, you can refer to the entire record as
<code>$*</code>.

<p/> <b>Out-of-stream variables</b> accessed using the <code>@</code> prefix. These
refer to data which persist from one record to the next, including in
<code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> blocks (which execute before/after the record
stream is consumed, respectively). You use them to remember values across
records, such as sums, differences, counters, and so on.  In a few contexts,
presented below, you can refer to the entire out-of-stream-variables collection
as <code>@*</code>.

<p/> <b>Local variables</b> are limited in scope and extent to the current
statements being executed: these include function arguments, bound variables in
for loops, and explicitly declared local variables.

<p/> <b>Keywords</b> are not variables, but since their names are reserved, you
cannot use these names for local variables.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Built-in variables</h2>

<p/> These are written all in capital letters, such as <code>NR</code>,
<code>NF</code>, <code>FILENAME</code>, and only a small, specific set of them is
defined by Miller.

<p/>Namely, Miller supports the following five built-in variables for <a
href="reference-verbs.html#filter"><code>filter</code></a> and <code>put</code>, all <code>awk</code>-inspired:
<code>NF</code>, <code>NR</code>, <code>FNR</code>, <code>FILENUM</code>, and
<code>FILENAME</code>, as well as the mathematical constants <code>M_PI</code> and
<code>M_E</code>.  Lastly, the <code>ENV</code> hashmap allows read access to environment
variables, e.g.  <code>ENV["HOME"]</code> or <code>ENV["foo_".$hostname]</code>.

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr filter 'FNR == 2' data/small*}}HERE

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$fnr = FNR' data/small*}}HERE

<p/> Their values of <code>NF</code>, <code>NR</code>, <code>FNR</code>, <code>FILENUM</code>,
and <code>FILENAME</code> change from one record to the next as Miller scans
through your input data stream. The mathematical constants, of course, do not
change; <code>ENV</code> is populated from the system environment variables at the
time Miller starts and is read-only for the remainder of program execution.

<p/> Their <b>scope is global</b>: you can refer to them in any <code>filter</code>
or <code>put</code> statement. Their values are assigned by the input-record
reader:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --csv put '$nr = NR' data/a.csv}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --csv repeat -n 3 then put '$nr = NR' data/a.csv}}HERE

<p/> The <b>extent</b> is for the duration of the put/filter: in a
<code>begin</code> statement (which executes before the first input record is
consumed) you will find <code>NR=1</code> and in an <code>end</code> statement (which
is executed after the last input record is consumed) you will find <code>NR</code>
to be the total number of records ingested.

<p/> These are all <b>read-only</b> for the <code>mlr put</code> and <code>mlr
filter</code> DSLs: they may be assigned from, e.g. <code>$nr=NR</code>, but they may
not be assigned to: <code>NR=100</code> is a syntax error.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Field names</h2>

<p/>Names of fields within stream records must be specified using a <code>$</code>
in <code>filter</code> and <a href="reference-verbs.html#put"><code>put</code></a>
expressions, even though the dollar signs don&rsquo;t appear in the data stream
itself. For integer-indexed data, this looks like <code>awk</code>&rsquo;s
<code>$1,$2,$3</code>, except that Miller allows non-numeric names such as
<code>$quantity</code> or <code>$hostname</code>.  Likewise, enclose string literals
in double quotes in <code>filter</code> expressions even though they don&rsquo;t
appear in file data.  In particular, <code>mlr filter '$x=="abc"'</code> passes
through the record <code>x=abc</code>.

<p/>If field names have <b>special characters</b> such as <code>.</code> then you
can use braces, e.g. <code>'${field.name}'</code>.

<p/>You may also use a <b>computed field name</b> in square brackets, e.g.

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{echo a=3,b=4 | mlr filter '$["x"] < 0.5'}}HERE

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{echo s=green,t=blue,a=3,b=4 | mlr put '$[$s."_".$t] = $a * $b'}}HERE

Notes:

<p/> The names of record fields depend on the contents of your input data stream, and their
values change from one record to the next as Miller scans through your input
data stream.

<p/> Their <b>extent</b> is limited to the current record; their <b>scope</b>
is the <code>filter</code> or <code>put</code> command in which they appear.

<p/> These are <b>read-write</b>: you can do <code>$y=2*$x</code>,
<code>$x=$x+1</code>, etc.

<p/> Records are Miller&rsquo;s output: field names present in the input
stream are passed through to output (written to standard output) unless fields
are removed with <code>cut</code>, or records are excluded with <code>filter</code> or
<code>put -q</code>, etc. Simply assign a value to a field and it will be output.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Positional field names</h2>

<p/> Even though Miller&rsquo;s main selling point is
name-indexing, sometimes you really want to refer to a field name by its
positional index (starting from 1).

<p/> Use <code>$[[3]]</code> to access the name of field 3.  More generally, any
expression evaluating to an integer can go between <code>$[[</code> and
<code>]]</code>.

Then using a computed field name, <code>$[ $[[3]] ]</code> is the value in the third field.
This has the shorter equivalent notation <code>$[[[3]]]</code>.

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr cat data/small}}HERE

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$[[3]] = "NEW"' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$[[[3]]] = "NEW"' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$NEW = $[[NR]]' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$NEW = $[[[NR]]]' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$[[[NR]]] = "NEW"' data/small}}HERE

Right-hand side accesses to non-existent fields &mdash; i.e. with index less
than 1 or greater than <code>NF</code> -- return an absent value. Likewise,
left-hand side accesses only refer to fields which already exist. For example,
if a field has 5 records then assigning the name or value of the 6th (or 600th)
field results in a no-op.

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$[[6]] = "NEW"' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$[[[6]]] = "NEW"' data/small}}HERE

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Out-of-stream variables</h2>

<p/> These are prefixed with an at-sign, e.g. <code>@sum</code>.  Furthermore,
unlike built-in variables and stream-record fields, they are maintained in an
arbitrarily nested hashmap: you can do <code>@sum += $quanity</code>, or
<code>@sum[$color] += $quanity</code>, or <code>@sum[$color][$shape] +=
$quanity</code>. The keys for the multi-level hashmap can be any expression which
evaluates to string or integer: e.g.  <code>@sum[NR] = $a + $b</code>,
<code>@sum[$a."-".$b] = $x</code>, etc.

<p/> Their names and their values are entirely under your control; they change
only when you assign to them.

<p/> Just as for field names in stream records, if you want to define out-of-stream variables
with <b>special characters</b> such as <code>.</code> then you can use braces, e.g. <code>'@{variable.name}["index"]'</code>.

<p/>You may use a <b>computed key </b> in square brackets, e.g.

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{echo s=green,t=blue,a=3,b=4 | mlr put -q '@[$s."_".$t] = $a * $b; emit all'}}HERE

<p/> Out-of-stream variables are <b>scoped</b> to the <code>put</code> command in
which they appear.  In particular, if you have two or more <code>put</code>
commands separated by <code>then</code>, each put will have its own set of
out-of-stream variables:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/a.dkvp}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '@sum += $a; end {emit @sum}' then put 'is_present($a) {$a=10*$a; @sum += $a}; end {emit @sum}' data/a.dkvp}}HERE

<p/> Out-of-stream variables&rsquo; <b>extent</b> is from the start to the end of the record stream,
i.e. every time the <code>put</code> or <code>filter</code> statement referring to them is executed.

<p/> Out-of-stream variables are <b>read-write</b>: you can do <code>$sum=@sum</code>, <code>@sum=$sum</code>,
etc.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Indexed out-of-stream variables</h2>

<p/>Using an index on the <code>@count</code> and <code>@sum</code> variables, we get the benefit of the
<code>-g</code> (group-by) option which <code>mlr stats1</code> and various other Miller commands have:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/begin-end-example-6.sh)HERE
POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/begin-end-example-7.sh)HERE

<p/>Indices can be arbitrarily deep &mdash; here there are two or more of them:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/begin-end-example-6a.sh)HERE

The idea is that <code>stats1</code>, and other Miller verbs, encapsulate
frequently-used patterns with a minimum of keystroking (and run a little
faster), whereas using out-of-stream variables you have more flexibility and
control in what you do.

<p/>Begin/end blocks can be mixed with pattern/action blocks. For example:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/begin-end-example-8.sh)HERE

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Local variables</h2>

<p/>Local variables are similar to out-of-stream variables, except that
their extent is limited to the expressions in which they appear (and their
basenames can&rsquo;t be computed using square brackets).
There are three kinds of local variables: <b>arguments</b> to
functions/subroutines, <b>variables bound within for-loops</b>, and
<b>locals</b> defined within control blocks. They may be untyped using
<code>var</code>, or typed using <code>num</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>,
<code>str</code>, <code>bool</code>, and <code>map</code>.

<p/>For example:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/local-example-1.sh)HERE

<p/>Things which are completely unsurprising, resembling many other languages:

<ul>

<li/> Parameter names are bound to their arguments but can be reassigned, e.g.
if there is a parameter named <code>a</code> then you can reassign the value of
<code>a</code> to be something else within the function if you like.

<li/> However, you cannot redeclare the <i>type</i> of an argument or a local:
<code>var a=1; var a=2</code> is an error but
<code>var a=1;  a=2</code> is OK.

<li/> All argument-passing is positional rather than by name; arguments are
passed by value, not by reference. (This is also true for map-valued variables:
they are not, and cannot be, passed by reference)

<li/> You can define locals (using <code>var</code>, <code>num</code>, etc.) at any
scope (if-statements, else-statements, while-loops, for-loops, or the top-level
scope), and nested scopes will have access (more details on scope in the next
section).  If you define a local variable with the same name inside an inner
scope, then a new variable is created with the narrower scope.

<li/> If you assign to a local variable for the first time in a scope without
declaring it as <code>var</code>, <code>num</code>, etc. then: if it exists in an outer
scope, that outer-scope variable will be updated; if not, it will be defined in
the current scope as if <code>var</code> had been used. (See also <a
href="#Type-checking">here</a> for an example.) I recommend always declaring
variables explicitly to make the intended scoping clear.

<li/> Functions and subroutines never have access to locals from their callee
(unless passed by value as arguments).

</ul>

<p/>Things which are perhaps surprising compared to other languages:

<ul>

<li/> Type declarations using <code>var</code>, or typed using <code>num</code>,
<code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>str</code>, and <code>bool</code> are necessary to
declare local variables.  Function arguments and variables bound in for-loops
over stream records and out-of-stream variables are <i>implicitly</i> declared
using <code>var</code>. (Some examples are shown below.)

<li/> Type-checking is done at assignment time. For example, <code>float f =
0</code> is an error (since <code>0</code> is an integer), as is <code>float f = 0.0; f
= 1</code>. For this reason I prefer to use <code>num</code> over <code>float</code> in
most contexts since <code>num</code> encompasses integer and floating-point values.
More information about type-checking is <a href="#Type-checking">here</a>.

<li/> Bound variables in for-loops over stream records and out-of-stream
variables are implicitly local to that block. E.g. in
<code>for (k, v in $*) { ... }</code>
<code>for ((k1, k2), v in @*) { ... }</code>
if there are <code>k</code>, <code>v</code>, etc. in the enclosing scope then those
will be masked by the loop-local bound variables in the loop, and moreover
the values of the loop-local bound variables are not available after the
end of the loop.

<li/> For C-style triple-for loops, if a for-loop variable is defined using
<code>var</code>, <code>int</code>, etc. then it is scoped to that for-loop. E.g.
<code>for (i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) { ... }</code> and <code>for (int i = 0; i < 10; i
+= 1) { ... }</code>. (This is unsurprising.). If there is no typedecl and an
outer-scope variable of that name exists, then it is used. (This is also
unsurprising.) But of there is no outer-scope variable of that name then the
variable is scoped to the for-loop only.

</ul>

<p/> The following example demonstrates the scope rules:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/scope-example.mlr}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/scope-example.dat}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --oxtab --from data/scope-example.dat put -f data/scope-example.mlr}}HERE

<p/> And this example demonstrates the type-declaration rules:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/type-decl-example.mlr}}HERE

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Map literals</h2>

<p/>Miller&rsquo;s <code>put</code>/<code>filter</code> DSL has four kinds of hashmaps.
<b>Stream records</b> are (single-level) maps from name to value.
<b>Out-of-stream variables</b> and <b>local variables</b> can also be maps,
although they can be multi-level hashmaps (e.g. <code>@sum[$x][$y]</code>).  The
fourth kind is <b>map literals</b>. These cannot be on the left-hand side of
assignment expressions. Syntactically they look like JSON, although Miller
allows string and integer keys in its map literals while JSON allows only
string keys (e.g. <code>"3"</code> rather than <code>3</code>).

<p/> For example, the following swaps the input stream&rsquo;s <code>a</code> and
<code>i</code> fields, modifies <code>y</code>, and drops the rest:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/map-literal-example-1.sh)HERE

<p/>Likewise, you can assign map literals to out-of-stream variables or local variables;
pass them as arguments to user-defined functions, return them from functions, and so on:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/map-literal-example-2.sh)HERE

<p/> Like out-of-stream and local variables, map literals can be multi-level:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/map-literal-example-3.sh)HERE

<p/>By default, map-valued expressions are dumped using JSON formatting. If you
use <code>dump</code> to print a hashmap with integer keys and you don&rsquo;t want
them double-quoted (JSON-style) then you can use <code>mlr put
--jknquoteint</code>. See also <code>mlr put --help</code>.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Type-checking</h2>

<p/> Miller&rsquo;s <code>put</code>/<code>filter</code> DSLs support two optional
kinds of type-checking.  One is inline <b>type-tests</b> and
<b>type-assertions</b> within expressions.  The other is <b>type
declarations</b> for assignments to local variables, binding of arguments to
user-defined functions, and return values from user-defined functions, These
are discussed in the following subsections.

<p/> Use of type-checking is entirely up to you: omit it if you want
flexibility with heterogeneous data; use it if you want to help catch
misspellings in your DSL code or unexpected irregularities in your input data.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h3>Type-test and type-assertion expressions</h3>

<p/> The following <code>is...</code> functions take a value and return a boolean
indicating whether the argument is of the indicated type. The
<code>assert_...</code> functions return their argument if it is of the specified
type, and cause a fatal error otherwise:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr -F | grep ^is}}HERE
</td>
<td>
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr -F | grep ^assert}}HERE
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p/> Please see the POKI_PUT_LINK_FOR_PAGE(cookbook.html#Data-cleaning_examples)HERE for examples
of how to use these.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h3>Type-declarations for local variables, function parameter, and function return values</h3>

<p/> Local variables can be defined either untyped as in <code>x = 1</code>, or
typed as in <code>int x = 1</code>. Types include <b>var</b> (explicitly untyped),
<b>int</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>num</b> (int or float), <b>str</b>, <b>bool</b>,
and <b>map</b>. These optional type declarations are enforced at the time
values are assigned to variables: whether at the initial value assignment as in
<code>int x = 1</code> or in any subsequent assignments to the same variable
farther down in the scope.

<p/> The reason for <code>num</code> is that <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> typedecls are very precise:

<div class="pokipanel">
<pre>
  float a = 0;   # Runtime error since 0 is int not float
  int   b = 1.0; # Runtime error since 1.0 is float not int
  num   c = 0;   # OK
  num   d = 1.0; # OK
</pre>
</div>

<p/> A suggestion is to use <code>num</code> for general use when you want numeric
content, and use <code>int</code> when you genuinely want integer-only values, e.g.
in loop indices or map keys (since Miller map keys can only be strings or
ints).

<p/> The <code>var</code> type declaration indicates no type restrictions, e.g.
<code>var x = 1</code> has the same type restrictions on <code>x</code> as <code>x =
1</code>. The difference is in intentional shadowing: if you have <code>x = 1</code>
in outer scope and <code>x = 2</code> in inner scope (e.g. within a for-loop or an
if-statement) then outer-scope <code>x</code> has value 2 after the second
assignment.  But if you have <code>var x = 2</code> in the inner scope, then you
are declaring a variable scoped to the inner block.) For example:

<div class="pokipanel">
<pre>
  x = 1;
  if (NR == 4) {
    x = 2; # Refers to outer-scope x: value changes from 1 to 2.
  }
  print x; # Value of x is now two
</pre>
</div>
<div class="pokipanel">
<pre>
  x = 1;
  if (NR == 4) {
    var x = 2; # Defines a new inner-scope x with value 2
  }
  print x;     # Value of this x is still 1
</pre>
</div>

<p/> Likewise function arguments can optionally be typed, with type enforced
when the function is called:

<div class="pokipanel">
<pre>
  func f(map m, int i) {
    ...
  }
  $a = f({1:2, 3:4}, 5);     # OK
  $b = f({1:2, 3:4}, "abc"); # Runtime error
  $c = f({1:2, 3:4}, $x);    # Runtime error for records with non-integer field named x
  if (NR == 4) {
    var x = 2; # Defines a new inner-scope x with value 2
  }
  print x;     # Value of this x is still 1
</pre>
</div>

<p/> Thirdly, function return values can be type-checked at the point of
<code>return</code> using <code>:</code> and a typedecl after the parameter list:

<div class="pokipanel">
<pre>
  func f(map m, int i): bool {
    ...
    ...
    if (...) {
      return "false"; # Runtime error if this branch is taken
    }
    ...
    ...
    if (...) {
      return retval; # Runtime error if this function doesn't have an in-scope
                     # boolean-valued variable named retval
    }
    ...
    ...
    # In Miller if your functions don't explicitly return a value, they return absent-null.
    # So it would also be a runtime error on reaching the end of this function without
    # an explicit return statement.
  }
</pre>
</div>

<h2>Aggregate variable assignments</h2>

<p/>There are three remaining kinds of variable assignment using out-of-stream
variables, the last two of which use the <code>$*</code> syntax:
<ul>
<li/> Recursive copy of out-of-stream variables
<li/> Out-of-stream variable assigned to full stream record
<li/> Full stream record assigned to an out-of-stream variable
</ul>

<p/> Example recursive copy of out-of-stream variables:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --opprint put -q '@v["sum"] += $x; @v["count"] += 1; end{dump; @w = @v; dump}' data/small}}HERE

<p/>Example of out-of-stream variable assigned to full stream record, where the 2nd record is stashed, and the 4th record is overwritten with that:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put 'NR == 2 {@keep = $*}; NR == 4 {$* = @keep}' data/small}}HERE

<p/>Example of full stream record assigned to an out-of-stream variable, finding
the record for which the <code>x</code> field has the largest value in the input
stream:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --opprint put -q 'is_null(@xmax) || $x > @xmax {@xmax=$x; @recmax=$*}; end {emit @recmax}' data/small}}HERE

<li/> Functions are in general pass-throughs straight to the system-standard C

<li/> The <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> functions are different from other
multi-argument functions which return null if any of their inputs are null: for
<code>min</code> and <code>max</code>, by contrast, if one argument is absent-null, the other

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Pattern-action blocks</h2>

<p/>These are reminiscent of <code>awk</code> syntax.  They can be used to allow
assignments to be done only when appropriate &mdash; e.g. for math-function
domain restrictions, regex-matching, and so on:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr cat data/put-gating-example-1.dkvp}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$x > 0.0 { $y = log10($x); $z = sqrt($y) }' data/put-gating-example-1.dkvp}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr cat data/put-gating-example-2.dkvp}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$a =~ "([a-z]+)_([0-9]+)" { $b = "left_\1"; $c = "right_\2" }' data/put-gating-example-2.dkvp}}HERE

<p/>This produces heteregenous output which Miller, of course, has no problems
with (see POKI_PUT_LINK_FOR_PAGE(record-heterogeneity.html)HERE).  But if you
want homogeneous output, the curly braces can be replaced with a semicolon
between the expression and the body statements.  This causes <code>put</code> to
evaluate the boolean expression (along with any side effects, namely,
regex-captures <code>\1</code>, <code>\2</code>, etc.) but doesn&rsquo;t use it as a
criterion for whether subsequent assignments should be executed. Instead,
subsequent assignments are done unconditionally:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$x > 0.0; $y = log10($x); $z = sqrt($y)' data/put-gating-example-1.dkvp}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '$a =~ "([a-z]+)_([0-9]+)"; $b = "left_\1"; $c = "right_\2"' data/put-gating-example-2.dkvp}}HERE

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>If-statements</h2>

<p/>These are again reminiscent of <code>awk</code>. Pattern-action blocks are a special case of <code>if</code> with no
<code>elif</code> or <code>else</code> blocks, no <code>if</code> keyword, and parentheses optional around the boolean expression:

POKI_CARDIFY{{mlr put 'NR == 4 {$foo = "bar"}'}}HERE
POKI_CARDIFY{{mlr put 'if (NR == 4) {$foo = "bar"}'}}HERE

<p/>Compound statements use <code>elif</code> (rather than <code>elsif</code> or <code>else if</code>):

POKI_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/if-chain.sh)HERE

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>While and do-while loops</h2>

<p/>Miller&rsquo;s <code>while</code> and <code>do-while</code> are unsurprising in
comparison to various languages, as are <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/while-example-1.sh)HERE
POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/while-example-2.sh)HERE

<p/> A <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> within nested conditional blocks or
if-statements will, of course, propagate to the innermost loop enclosing them,
if any. A <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> outside a loop is a syntax error
that will be flagged as soon as the expression is parsed, before any input
records are ingested.

<p/> The existence of <code>while</code>, <code>do-while</code>, and <code>for</code> loops
in Miller&rsquo;s DSL means that you can create infinite-loop scenarios
inadvertently.  In particular, please recall that DSL statements are executed
once if in <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> blocks, and once <i>per record</i>
otherwise. For example, <b><code>while (NR < 10)</code> will never terminate as
<code>NR</code> is only incremented between records</b>.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>For-loops</h2>

<p/>While Miller&rsquo;s <code>while</code> and <code>do-while</code> statements are
much as in many other languages, <code>for</code> loops are more idiosyncratic to
Miller. They are loops over key-value pairs, whether in stream records,
out-of-stream variables, local variables, or map-literals: more reminiscent of
<code>foreach</code>, as in (for example) PHP. There are <b>for-loops over map
keys</b> and <b>for-loops over key-value tuples</b>.  Additionally, Miller has a
<b>C-style triple-for loop</b> with initialize, test, and update statements.

<p/>As with <code>while</code> and <code>do-while</code>, a <code>break</code> or
<code>continue</code> within nested control structures will propagate to the
innermost loop enclosing them, if any, and a <code>break</code> or
<code>continue</code> outside a loop is a syntax error that will be flagged as soon
as the expression is parsed, before any input records are ingested.

<h3>Key-only for-loops </h3>

<p/>The <code>key</code> variable is always bound to the <i>key</i> of key-value pairs:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/single-for-example-1.sh)HERE
POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/single-for-example-2.sh)HERE

<p/>Note that the value corresponding to a given key may be gotten as through a
<b>computed field name</b> using square brackets as in <code>$[key]</code> for
stream records, or by indexing the looped-over variable using square brackets.

<h3>Key-value for-loops </h3>

<p/>Single-level keys may be gotten at using either <code>for(k,v)</code> or
<code>for((k),v)</code>; multi-level keys may be gotten at using
<code>for((k1,k2,k3),v)</code> and so on.  The <code>v</code> variable will be bound to
to a scalar value (a string or a number) if the map stops at that level, or to
a map-valued variable if the map goes deeper. If the map isn&rsquo;t deep
enough then the loop body won&rsquo;t be executed.

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/for-srec-example.tbl}}HERE
POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/for-srec-example-1.sh)HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --from data/small --opprint put 'for (k,v in $*) { $[k."_type"] = typeof(v) }'}}HERE

<p/>Note that the value of the current field in the for-loop can be gotten either using the bound
variable <code>value</code>, or through a <b>computed field name</b> using square brackets as in <code>$[key]</code>.

<p/>Important note: to avoid inconsistent looping behavior in case you&rsquo;re
setting new fields (and/or unsetting existing ones) while looping over the
record, <b>Miller makes a copy of the record before the loop: loop variables
are bound from the copy and all other reads/writes involve the record
itself</b>:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/for-srec-example-2.sh)HERE

It can be confusing to modify the stream record while iterating over a copy of it, so
instead you might find it simpler to use a local variable in the loop and only update
the stream record after the loop:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/for-srec-example-3.sh)HERE

<p/>You can also start iterating on sub-hashmaps of an out-of-stream or local
variable; you can loop over nested keys; you can loop over all out-of-stream
variables.  The bound variables are bound to a copy of the sub-hashmap as it
was before the loop started.  The sub-hashmap is specified by square-bracketed
indices after <code>in</code>, and additional deeper indices are bound to loop
key-variables. The terminal values are bound to the loop value-variable
whenever the keys are not too shallow. The value-variable may refer to a
terminal (string, number) or it may be map-valued if the map goes deeper.
Example indexing is as follows:

POKI_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/for-oosvar-example-0a.txt)HERE

<p/>That&rsquo;s confusing in the abstract, so a concrete example is in order.
Suppose the out-of-stream variable <code>@myvar</code> is populated as follows:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/for-oosvar-example-0b.sh)HERE

<p/> Then we can get at various values as follows:

<table><tr><td>
POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/for-oosvar-example-0c.sh)HERE
</td><td>
POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/for-oosvar-example-0d.sh)HERE
</td><td>
POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/for-oosvar-example-0e.sh)HERE
</td></tr></table>

<h3>C-style triple-for loops</h3>

<p/> These are supported as follows:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/triple-for-example-1.sh)HERE
POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/triple-for-example-2.sh)HERE

Notes:
<ul>

<li/> In <code>for (start; continuation; update) { body }</code>, the start,
continuation, and update statements may be empty, single statements, or
multiple comma-separated statements. If the continuation is empty (e.g. <code>for(i=1;;i+=1)</code>) it defaults
to true.

<li/> In particular, you may use <code>$</code>-variables and/or
<code>@</code>-variables in the start, continuation, and/or update steps (as well
as the body, of course).

<li/> The typedecls such as <code>int</code> or <code>num</code> are optional.  If a
typedecl is provided (for a local variable), it binds a variable scoped to the
for-loop regardless of whether a same-name variable is present in outer scope.
If a typedecl is not provided, then the variable is scoped to the for-loop if
no same-name variable is present in outer scope, or if a same-name variable is
present in outer scope then it is modified.

<li/> Miller has no <code>++</code> or <code>--</code> operators.

<li/> As with all for/if/while statements in Miller, the curly braces are
required even if the body is a single statement, or empty.

</ul>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Begin/end blocks</h2>

<p/>Miller supports an <code>awk</code>-like <code>begin/end</code> syntax.  The
statements in the <code>begin</code> block are executed before any input records
are read; the statements in the <code>end</code> block are executed after the last
input record is read.  (If you want to execute some statement at the start of
each file, not at the start of the first file as with <code>begin</code>, you might
use a pattern/action block of the form <code>FNR == 1 { ... }</code>.) All
statements outside of <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> are, of course, executed
on every input record. Semicolons separate statements inside or outside of
begin/end blocks; semicolons are required between begin/end block bodies and
any subsequent statement.  For example:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/begin-end-example-1.sh)HERE

<p/>Since uninitialized out-of-stream variables default to 0 for
addition/substraction and 1 for multiplication when they appear on expression
right-hand sides (as in <code>awk</code>), the above can be written more succinctly
as

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/begin-end-example-2.sh)HERE

<p/>The <b>put -q</b> option is a shorthand which suppresses printing of each
output record, with only <code>emit</code> statements being output. So to get only
summary outputs, one could write

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/begin-end-example-3.sh)HERE

<p/>We can do similarly with multiple out-of-stream variables:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/begin-end-example-4.sh)HERE

This is of course not much different than

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/begin-end-example-5.sh)HERE

<p/>Note that it&rsquo;s a syntax error for begin/end blocks to refer to field
names (beginning with <code>$</code>), since these execute outside the context of
input records.

</div>
<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h1>Output statements</h1>
<button style="font-weight:bold;color:maroon;border:0" padding=0 onclick="vis_toggle_by_name('body_section_toggle_output_statements');" href="javascript:;">Toggle section visibility</button>
<div id="body_section_toggle_output_statements" style="display: block">

<p/>You can <b>output</b> variable-values or expressions in <b>five ways</b>:

<ul>

<li/> <b>Assign</b> them to stream-record fields. For example,
<code>$cumulative_sum = @sum</code>. For another example, <code>$nr = NR</code> adds a
field named <code>nr</code> to each output record, containing the value of the
built-in variable <code>NR</code> as of when that record was ingested.

<li/> Use the <b>print</b> or <b>eprint</b> keywords which immediately print an
expression <i>directly to standard output or standard error</i>, respectively.
Note that <code>dump</code>, <code>edump</code>, <code>print</code>, and <code>eprint</code>
don&rsquo;t output records which participate in <code>then</code>-chaining; rather,
they&rsquo;re just immediate prints to stdout/stderr. The <code>printn</code> and
<code>eprintn</code> keywords are the same except that they don&rsquo;t print final
newlines. Additionally, you can print to a specified file instead of
stdout/stderr.

<li/> Use the <b>dump</b> or <b>edump</b> keywords, which <i>immediately print
all out-of-stream variables as a JSON data structure to the standard output or
standard error</i> (respectively).

<li/> Use <b>tee</b> which formats the current stream record (not just an
arbitrary string as with <b>print</b>) to a specific file.

<li/> Use <b>emit</b>/<b>emitp</b>/<b>emitf</b> to send out-of-stream
variables&rsquo; current values to the output record stream, e.g.  <code>@sum +=
$x; emit @sum</code> which produces an extra output record such as
<code>sum=3.1648382</code>.

</ul>

<p/>For the first two options you are populating the output-records stream
which feeds into the next verb in a <code>then</code>-chain (if any), or which otherwise
is formatted for output using <code>--o...</code> flags.

<p/>For the last three options you are sending output directly to standard
output, standard error, or a file.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Print statements</h2>

<p/>The <code>print</code> statement is perhaps self-explanatory, but with a few
light caveats:

<ul>

<li/> There are four variants: <code>print</code> goes to stdout with final
newline, <code>printn</code> goes to stdout without final newline (you can include
one using "\n" in your output string), <code>eprint</code> goes to stderr with
final newline, and <code>eprintn</code> goes to stderr without final newline.

<li/> Output goes directly to stdout/stderr, respectively: data produced this
way do not go downstream to the next verb in a <code>then</code>-chain. (Use
<code>emit</code> for that.)

<li/> Print statements are for strings (<code>print "hello"</code>), or things
which can be made into strings: numbers (<code>print 3</code>, <code>print $a +
$b</code>, or concatenations thereof (<code>print "a + b = " . ($a + $b)</code>).
Maps (in <code>$*</code>, map-valued out-of-stream or local variables, and map
literals) aren&rsquo;t convertible into strings. If you print a map, you get
<code>{is-a-map}</code> as output. Please use <code>dump</code> to print maps.

<li/>You can redirect print output to a file:
<code>mlr --from myfile.dat put 'print &gt; "tap.txt", $x'</code>
<code>mlr --from myfile.dat put 'o=$*; print &gt; $a.".txt", $x'</code>.

<li/> See also the <a href="#Redirected-output_statements">section on redirected output</a> for examples.

</ul>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Dump statements</h2>

<p/>The <code>dump</code> statement is for printing expressions, including maps,
directly to stdout/stderr, respectively:

<ul>

<li/> There are two variants: <code>dump</code> prints to stdout; <code>edump</code>
prints to stderr.

<li/> Output goes directly to stdout/stderr, respectively: data produced this
way do not go downstream to the next verb in a <code>then</code>-chain. (Use
<code>emit</code> for that.)

<li/> You can use <code>dump</code> to output single strings, numbers,
or expressions including map-valued data. Map-valued data are printed
as JSON. Miller allows string and integer keys in its map literals while
JSON allows only string keys, so use <code>mlr put --jknquoteint</code> if
you want integer-valued map keys not double-quoted.

<li/> If you use <code>dump</code> (or <code>edump</code>) with no arguments, you get a
JSON structure representing the current values of all out-of-stream variables.

<li/> As with <code>print</code>, you can redirect output to files.

<li/> See also the <a href="#Redirected-output_statements">section on redirected output</a> for examples.

</ul>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Tee statements</h2>

<p/> Records produced by a <code>mlr put</code> go downstream to the next verb in
your <code>then</code>-chain, if any, or otherwise to standard output.  If you want
to additionally copy out records to files, you can do that using <code>tee</code>.

<p/>The syntax is, by example, <code>mlr --from myfile.dat put 'tee &gt;
"tap.dat", $*' then sort -n index</code>.  First is <code>tee &gt;</code>, then the
filename expression (which can be an expression such as
<code>"tap.".$a.".dat"</code>), then a comma, then <code>$*</code>. (Nothing else but
<code>$*</code> is teeable.)

<p/> See also the <a href="#Redirected-output_statements">section on redirected
output</a> for examples.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Redirected-output statements</h2>

The <b>print</b>, <b>dump</b> <b>tee</b>, <b>emitf</b>, <b>emit</b>, and
<b>emitp</b> keywords all allow you to redirect output to one or more files or
pipe-to commands. The filenames/commands are strings which can be constructed
using record-dependent values, so you can do things like splitting a table into
multiple files, one for each account ID, and so on.

<p/> Details:

<ul>

<li/> The <code>print</code> and <code>dump</code> keywords produce output immediately
to standard output, or to specified file(s) or pipe-to command if present.

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --help-keyword print}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --help-keyword dump}}HERE

<li/> <code>mlr put</code> sends the current record (possibly modified by the
<code>put</code> expression) to the output record stream. Records are then input to
the following verb in a <code>then</code>-chain (if any), else printed to standard
output (unless <code>put -q</code>). The <b>tee</b> keyword <i>additionally</i>
writes the output record to specified file(s) or pipe-to command, or
immediately to <code>stdout</code>/<code>stderr</code>.

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --help-keyword tee}}HERE

<li/> <code>mlr put</code>&rsquo;s <code>emitf</code>, <code>emitp</code>, and
<code>emit</code> send out-of-stream variables to the output record stream. These
are then input to the following verb in a <code>then</code>-chain (if any), else
printed to standard output. When redirected with <code>&gt;</code>,
<code>&gt;&gt;</code>, or <code>|</code>, they <i>instead</i> write the out-of-stream
variable(s) to specified file(s) or pipe-to command, or immediately to
<code>stdout</code>/<code>stderr</code>.

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --help-keyword emitf}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --help-keyword emitp}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --help-keyword emit}}HERE

</ul>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Emit statements</h2>

<p/>There are three variants: <code>emitf</code>, <code>emit</code>, and
<code>emitp</code>. Keep in mind that out-of-stream variables are a nested,
multi-level hashmap (directly viewable as JSON using <code>dump</code>), whereas
Miller output records are lists of single-level key-value pairs. The three emit
variants allow you to control how the multilevel hashmaps are flatten down to
output records. You can emit any map-valued expression, including <code>$*</code>,
map-valued out-of-stream variables, the entire out-of-stream-variable
collection <code>@*</code>, map-valued local variables, map literals, or map-valued
function return values.

<p/>Use <b>emitf</b> to output several out-of-stream variables side-by-side in the same output record.
For <code>emitf</code> these mustn&rsquo;t have indexing using <code>@name[...]</code>. Example:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@count += 1; @x_sum += $x; @y_sum += $y; end { emitf @count, @x_sum, @y_sum}' data/small}}HERE

<p/>Use <b>emit</b> to output an out-of-stream variable. If it&rsquo;s non-indexed you&rsquo;ll get a simple key-value pair:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@sum += $x; end { dump }' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@sum += $x; end { emit @sum }' data/small}}HERE

<p/>If it&rsquo;s indexed then use as many names after <code>emit</code> as there are indices:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@sum[$a] += $x; end { dump }' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@sum[$a] += $x; end { emit @sum, "a" }' data/small}}HERE

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@sum[$a][$b] += $x; end { dump }' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@sum[$a][$b] += $x; end { emit @sum, "a", "b" }' data/small}}HERE

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@sum[$a][$b][$i] += $x; end { dump }' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@sum[$a][$b][$i] += $x; end { emit @sum, "a", "b", "i" }' data/small}}HERE

<p/>Now for <b>emitp</b>: if you have as many names following <code>emit</code> as
there are levels in the out-of-stream variable&rsquo;s hashmap, then <code>emit</code> and <code>emitp</code> do the same
thing. Where they differ is when you don&rsquo;t specify as many names as there are hashmap levels. In this
case, Miller needs to flatten multiple map indices down to output-record keys: <code>emitp</code> includes full
prefixing (hence the <code>p</code> in <code>emitp</code>) while <code>emit</code> takes the deepest hashmap key as the
output-record key:

<h2>Multi-emit statements</h2>

<p/>You can emit <b>multiple map-valued expressions side-by-side</b> by
including their names in parentheses:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/emit-lashed.sh)HERE

What this does is walk through the first out-of-stream variable
(<code>@x_sum</code> in this example) as usual, then for each keylist found (e.g.
<code>pan,wye</code>), include the values for the remaining out-of-stream variables
(here, <code>@x_count</code> and <code>@x_mean</code>). You should use this when all
out-of-stream variables in the emit statement have <b>the same shape and the same
keylists</b>.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>Emit-all statements</h2>

<p/>Use <b>emit all</b> (or <code>emit @*</code> which is synonymous) to output all
out-of-stream variables. You can use the following idiom to get various
accumulators output side-by-side (reminiscent of <code>mlr stats1</code>):

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --from data/small --opprint put -q '@v[$a][$b]["sum"] += $x; @v[$a][$b]["count"] += 1; end{emit @*,"a","b"}'}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --from data/small --opprint put -q '@sum[$a][$b] += $x; @count[$a][$b] += 1; end{emit @*,"a","b"}'}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --from data/small --opprint put -q '@sum[$a][$b] += $x; @count[$a][$b] += 1; end{emit (@sum, @count),"a","b"}'}}HERE

<div id="body_section_toggle_unset_statements" style="display: block">

<p/>You can clear a map key by assigning the empty string as its value: <code>$x=""</code> or <code>@x=""</code>.
Using <code>unset</code> you can remove the key entirely. Examples:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put 'unset $x, $a' data/small}}HERE

<p/>This can also be done, of course, using <code>mlr cut -x</code>. You can also
clear out-of-stream or local variables, at the base name level, or at an
indexed sublevel:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@sum[$a][$b] += $x; end { dump; unset @sum; dump }' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put -q '@sum[$a][$b] += $x; end { dump; unset @sum["eks"]; dump }' data/small}}HERE

<p/>If you use <code>unset all</code> (or <code>unset @*</code> which is synonymous), that will unset all out-of-stream
variables which have been defined up to that point.

<p/> You can use <code>filter</code> within <code>put</code>. In fact, the
following two are synonymous:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr filter 'NR==2 || NR==3' data/small}}HERE
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put 'filter NR==2 || NR==3' data/small}}HERE

<p/>The former, of course, is much easier to type. But the latter allows you to define more complex expressions
for the filter, and/or do other things in addition to the filter:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr put '@running_sum += $x; filter @running_sum > 1.3' data/small}}HERE

positional rather than by name; arguments are passed by value, not by

<p/> As of Miller 5.0.0 you can define your own functions, as well as subroutines.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>User-defined functions</h2>

<p/>Here&rsquo;s the obligatory example of a recursive function to compute the factorial function:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/factorial-example.sh)HERE

<p/>Properties of user-defined functions:

<ul>

<li/> Function bodies start with <code>func</code> and a parameter list, defined
outside of <code>begin</code>, <code>end</code>, or other <code>func</code> or
<code>subr</code> blocks. (I.e. the Miller DSL has no nested functions.)

<li/> A function (uniqified by its name) may not be redefined: either by
redefining a user-defined function, or by redefining a built-in function.
However, functions and subroutines have separate namespaces: you can define a
subroutine <code>log</code> which does not clash with the mathematical <code>log</code>
function.

<li/> Functions may be defined either before or after use (there is an
object-binding/linkage step at startup).  More specifically, functions may be
either recursive or mutually recursive. Functions may not call subroutines.

<li/> Functions may be defined and called either within <code>mlr put</code> or
<code>mlr put</code>.

<li/> Functions have read access to <code>$</code>-variables and
<code>@</code>-variables but may not modify them.
See also
<a href="cookbook.html#Memoization_with_out-of-stream_variables">this cookbook item</a> for an example.

<li/> Argument values may be reassigned: they are not read-only.

<li/> When a return value is not implicitly returned, this results in a return
value of absent-null. (In the example above, if there were records for which
the argument to <code>f</code> is non-numeric, the assignments would be skipped.)
See also the section on
<a href="#Null_data:_empty_and_absent">empty_and_absent null data</a>.

<li/> See the section on <a href="#Local_variables">local variables</a> for
information on scope and extent of arguments, as well as for information on the
use of local variables within functions.

<li/> See the section on <a href="#Expressions_from_files">expressions from
files</a> for information on the use of <code>-f</code> and <code>-e</code> flags.

</ul>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<h2>User-defined subroutines</h2>

<p/>Example:

POKI_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/subr-example.sh)HERE

<p/>Properties of user-defined subroutines:

<ul>

<li/> Subroutine bodies start with <code>subr</code> and a parameter list, defined
outside of <code>begin</code>, <code>end</code>, or other <code>func</code> or
<code>subr</code> blocks. (I.e. the Miller DSL has no nested subroutines.)

<li/> A subroutine (uniqified by its name) may not be redefined.

<h1>Errors and transparency</h1>
<button style="font-weight:bold;color:maroon;border:0" padding=0 onclick="vis_toggle_by_name('body_section_toggle_transparency');" href="javascript:;">Toggle section visibility</button>
<div id="body_section_toggle_transparency" style="display: block">

<p/>As soon as you have a programming language, you start having the problem
<i>What is my code doing, and why?</i> This includes getting syntax errors
&mdash; which are always annoying &mdash; as well as the even more annoying
problem of a program which parses without syntax error but doesn&rsquo;t do
what you expect.

<p/> The <code>syntax error</code> message is cryptic: it says <code>syntax error at
</code> followed by the next symbol it couldn&rsquo;t parse. This is good, but
(as of 5.0.0) it doesn&rsquo;t say things like <code>syntax error at line 17,
character 22</code>. Here are some common causes of syntax errors:

<ul>

<li/> Don&rsquo;t forget <code>;</code> at end of line, before another statement on
the next line.

<li/> Miller&rsquo;s DSL lacks the <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> operators.

<li/> Curly braces are required for the bodies of
<code>if</code>/<code>while</code>/<code>for</code> blocks, even when the body is a single
statement.

</ul>

<p/>Now for transparency:

<ul>

<li/>As in any language, you can do
<a href="#Print_statements"><code>print</code></a> (or <code>eprint</code> to print to
stderr). See also <a href="#Dump_statements"><code>dump</code></a> and <a
href="#Emit_statements"><code>emit</code></a>.

<li/> The <code>-v</code> option to <code>mlr put</code> and <code>mlr filter</code> prints
abstract syntax trees for your code. While not all details here will be of
interest to everyone, certainly this makes questions such as operator
precedence completely unambiguous.

<li/> The <code>-T</code> option prints a trace of each statement executed.

<li/> The <code>-t</code> and <code>-a</code> options show low-level details for the
parsing process and for stack-variable-index allocation, respectively. These
will likely be of interest to people who enjoy compilers, and probably less
useful for a more general audience.

<li/> Please see the <a href="#Type-checking">type-checking section</a> for
type declarations and type-assertions you can use to make sure expressions and
the data flowing them are evaluating as you expect.  I made them optional
because one of Miller&rsquo;s important use-cases is being able to say simple
things like <code>mlr put '$y = $x + 1' myfile.dat</code> with a minimum of
punctuational bric-a-brac &mdash; but for programs over a few lines I generally
find that the more type-specification, the better.

<h1>A note on the complexity of Miller&rsquo;s expression language</h1>
<button style="font-weight:bold;color:maroon;border:0" padding=0 onclick="vis_toggle_by_name('body_section_toggle_a_note_on_complexity');" href="javascript:;">Toggle section visibility</button>
<div id="body_section_toggle_a_note_on_complexity" style="display: block">

<p/> One of Miller&rsquo;s strengths is its brevity: it&rsquo;s much quicker
&mdash; and less error-prone &mdash; to type <code>mlr stats1 -a sum -f x,y -g
a,b</code> than having to track summation variables as in <code>awk</code>, or using
Miller&rsquo;s out-of-stream variables. And the more language features
Miller&rsquo;s put-DSL has (for-loops, if-statements, nested control
structures, user-defined functions, etc.) then the <i>less</i> powerful it
begins to seem: because of the other programming-language features it
<i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> have (classes, execptions, and so on).

<p/> When I was originally prototyping Miller in 2015, the decision I had was
whether to hand-code in a low-level language like C or Rust, with my own
hand-rolled DSL, or whether to use a higher-level language (like Python or Lua
or Nim) and let the <code>put</code> statements be handled by the implementation
language&rsquo;s own <code>eval</code>: the implementation language would take the
place of a DSL. Multiple performance experiments showed me I could get better
throughput using the former, and using C in particular &mdash; by a wide margin. So
Miller is C under the hood with a hand-rolled DSL.

<p/> I do want to keep focusing on what Miller is good at &mdash; concise
notation, low latency, and high throughput &mdash; and not add too much in
terms of high-level-language features to the DSL.  That said, some sort of
customizability is a basic thing to want. As of 4.1.0 we have recursive
for/while/if structures on about the same complexity level as <code>awk</code>; as
of 5.0.0 we have user-defined functions and map-valued variables, again on
about the same complexity level as <code>awk</code> along with optional
type-declaration syntax.  While I&rsquo;m excited by these powerful language
features, I hope to keep new features beyond 5.0.0 focused on Miller&rsquo;s
sweet spot which is speed plus simplicity.
