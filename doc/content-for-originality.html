<p/> It isn&rsquo;t. Miller is one of many, many participants in the
online-analytical-processing culture. Other key participants include
<code>awk</code>, SQL, spreadsheets, etc. etc.  etc.  Far from being an original
concept, Miller explicitly strives to imitate several existing tools:

<p/>
<span class="boldmaroon">Unix toolkit</span>: Intentional similarities as described in
POKI_PUT_LINK_FOR_PAGE(feature-comparison.html)HERE.

<p/>Recipes abound for command-line data analysis using the Unix toolkit. Here are just a couple of my favorites:
<ul>

</ul>

<p/> <span class="boldmaroon">RecordStream</span>: Miller owes particular inspiration
to <a href="https://github.com/benbernard/RecordStream">RecordStream</a>. The
key difference is that RecordStream is a Perl-based tool for manipulating JSON
(including requiring it to separately manipulate other formats such as CSV into
and out of JSON), while Miller is fast C which handles its formats natively.
The similarities include the <code>sort</code>, <code>stats1</code> (analog of
RecordStream&rsquo;s <code>collate</code>), and <code>delta</code> operations, as well
as <code>filter</code> and <code>put</code>, and pretty-print formatting.

<p/> <span class="boldmaroon">stats_m</span>: A third source of lineage is my Python
<a href="https://github.com/johnkerl/scripts-math/tree/master/stats">stats_m</a>
module.  This includes simple single-pass algorithms which form Miller&rsquo;s
<code>stats1</code> and <code>stats2</code> subcommands.

<p/> <span class="boldmaroon">SQL</span>: Fourthly, Miller&rsquo;s <code>group-by</code> command
name is from SQL, as is the term <code>aggregate</code>.

<p/> <span class="boldmaroon">Added value</span>:
Miller&rsquo;s added values include:
<ul>
<li> Name-indexing, compared to the Unix toolkit&rsquo;s positional indexing.
<li> Raw speed, compared to <code>awk</code>, RecordStream, <code>stats_m</code>, or various other kinds of Python/Ruby/etc. scripts one can easily create.
<li> Compact keystroking for many common tasks, with a decent amount of flexibility.
<li> Ability to handle text files on the Unix pipe, without need for creating database tables, compared to SQL databases.
<li> Various file formats, and on-the-fly format conversion.
</ul>

<p/><span class="boldmaroon">jq</span>: Miller does for name-indexed text what
<a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> does for JSON. If you&rsquo;re
not already familiar with <code>jq</code>, please <a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">check it out!</a>.

<p/><span class="boldmaroon">What about similar tools?</span>
Here&rsquo;s a comprehensive list:
<a href="https://github.com/dbohdan/structured-text-tools">https://github.com/dbohdan/structured-text-tools</a>.
It doesn&rsquo;t mention <a href="https://github.com/turicas/rows">rows</a> so here&rsquo;s a plug for that as well.
As it turns out, I learned about most of these after writing Miller.

<p/><span class="boldmaroon">What about DOTADIW?</span> One of the key points of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a> is
that a tool should do one thing and do it well.  Hence <code>sort</code> and
<code>cut</code> do just one thing. Why does Miller put <code>awk</code>-like
processing, a few SQL-like operations, and statistical reduction all into one
tool (see also POKI_PUT_LINK_FOR_PAGE(reference.html)HERE)?  This is a fair
question. First note that many standard tools, such as <code>awk</code> and
<code>perl</code>, do quite a few things &mdash; as does <code>jq</code>.  But I could
have pushed for putting format awareness and name-indexing options into
<code>cut</code>, <code>awk</code>, and so on (so you could do <code>cut -f
hostname,uptime</code> or <code>awk '{sum += $x*$y}END{print sum}'</code>).  Patching
<code>cut</code>, <code>sort</code>, etc. on multiple operating systems is a
non-starter in terms of uptake.  Moreover, it makes sense for me to have Miller
be a tool which collects together format-aware record-stream processing into
one place, with good reuse of Miller-internal library code for its various
features.

<p/><span class="boldmaroon">Why not use Perl/Python/Ruby etc.?</span> Maybe you
should. With those tools you&rsquo;ll get far more expressive power, and
sufficiently quick turnaround time for small-to-medium-sized data.  Using
Miller you&rsquo;ll get something less than a complete programming language,
but which is fast, with moderate amounts of flexibility and much less
keystroking.

<p/>When I was first developing Miller I made a survey of several languages.
Using low-level implementation languages like C, Go, Rust, and Nim, I&rsquo;d
need to create my own domain-specific language (DSL) which would always be less
featured than a full programming language, but I&rsquo;d get better
performance.  Using high-level interpreted languages such as Perl/Python/Ruby
I&rsquo;d get the language&rsquo;s <code>eval</code> for free and I wouldn&rsquo;t
need a DSL; Miller would have mainly been a set of format-specific I/O hooks.
If I&rsquo;d gotten good enough performance from the latter I&rsquo;d have done
it without question and Miller would be far more flexible.  But C won the
performance criteria by a landslide so we have Miller in C with a custom DSL.

<p/> <span class="boldmaroon">No, really, why one more command-line data-manipulation
tool?</span> I wrote Miller because I was frustrated with tools like
<code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, and so on being <i>line-aware</i> without being
<i>format-aware</i>. The single most poignant example I can think of is seeing
people grep data lines out of their CSV files and sadly losing their header
lines.  While some lighter-than-SQL processing is very nice to have, at core I
wanted the format-awareness of <a
href="https://github.com/benbernard/RecordStream">RecordStream</a> combined
with the raw speed of the Unix toolkit. Miller does precisely that.
