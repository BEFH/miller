<button style="font-weight:bold;color:maroon;border:0" onclick="vis_collapse_all_body_sections();" href="javascript:;">Collapse all sections</button>

<p/> Someone asked me the other day about design, tradeoffs, thought process,
why I felt it necessary to build Miller, etc. Here are some answers.

<a id="Who_is_Miller_for?"/><h1>Who is Miller for?</h1>
<button style="font-weight:bold;color:maroon;border:0" padding=0 onclick="vis_toggle_by_name('body_section_toggle_who_is_miller_for');" href="javascript:;">Toggle section visibility</button>
<div id="body_section_toggle_who_is_miller_for" style="display: block">

<p/> For background, I&rsquo;m a software engineer, with a heavy devops bent
and a non-trivial amount of data-engineering in my career.
<boldmaroon>Initially I wrote Miller mainly for myself:</boldmaroon> I&rsquo;m
coder-friendly (being a coder); I&rsquo;m Github-friendly; most of my data are
well-structured or easily structurable (TSV-formatted SQL-query output, CSV
files, log files, JSON data structures); I care about interoperability between
all the various formats Miller supports (I&rsquo;ve encountered them all); I do
all my work on Linux or OSX.

<p/> But now there&rsquo;s this neat little tool <boldmaroon>which seems to be
useful for people in various disciplines</boldmaroon>. I don&rsquo;t even know
entirely <i>who</i>. I can click through Github starrers and read a bit about
what they seem to do, but not everyone&rsquo;s <i>on</i> Github (or stars
things). I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of feature requests through Github &mdash; but
only from people who are Github users.  Not everyone&rsquo;s a coder (it seems
like a lot of Miller&rsquo;s Github starrers are devops folks like myself, or
data-science-ish people, or biology/genomics folks.) A lot of people care 100%
about CSV. And so on.

<p/> So I wonder (please drop a note at <a
href="https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues">https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues</a>)
does Miller do what you need? Do you use it for all sorts of things, or just
one or two nice things? Are there things you wish it did but it doesn&rsquo;t?
Is it almost there, or just nowhere near what you want? Are there not enough
features or way too many? Are the docs too complicated; do you have a hard time
finding out how to do what you want? Should I think differently about what this
tool even <i>is</i> in the first place? Should I think differently about who
it&rsquo;s for?

</div>
<a id="What_was_Miller_created_to_do?"/><h1>What was Miller created to do?</h1>
<button style="font-weight:bold;color:maroon;border:0" padding=0 onclick="vis_toggle_by_name('body_section_toggle_what_was_miller_created_to_do');" href="javascript:;">Toggle section visibility</button>
<div id="body_section_toggle_what_was_miller_created_to_do" style="display: block">

<p/> First: there are tools like <code>xsv</code> which handles CSV marvelously and
<code>jq</code> which handles JSON marvelously, and so on &mdash; but I over the
years of my career in the software industry I&rsquo;ve found myself, and
others, doing a lot of ad-hoc things which really were fundamentally the same
<i>except</i> for format. So the number one thing about Miller is doing common
things while supporting <boldmaroon>multiple formats</boldmaroon>: (a) ingest a
list of records where a record is a list of key-value pairs (however
represented in the input files); (b) transform that stream of records; (c) emit
the transformed stream &mdash; either in the same format as input, or in a
different format.

<p/> Second thing, a lot like the first: just as I didn&rsquo;t want to build
something only for a single file format, I didn&rsquo;t want to build something
only for one problem domain. In my work doing software engineering, devops,
data engineering, etc. I saw a lot of commonalities and I wanted to
<boldmaroon>solve as many problems simultaneously as possible</boldmaroon>.

<p/> Third: it had to be <boldmaroon>streaming</boldmaroon>. As time goes by
and we (some of us, sometimes) have machines with tens or hundreds of GB of
RAM, it&rsquo;s maybe less important, but I&rsquo;m unhappy with tools which
ingest all data, then do stuff, then emit all data. One reason is to be able to
handle files bigger than available RAM. Another reason is to be able to handle
input which trickles in, e.g.  you have some process emitting data now and then
and you can pipe it to Miller and it will emit transformed records one at a
time.

<p/> Fourth: it had to be <boldmaroon>fast</boldmaroon>. This precludes all
sorts of very nice things written in Ruby, for example. I love Ruby as a very
expressive language, and I have several very useful little utility scripts
written in Ruby. But a few years ago I ported over some of my old
tried-and-true C programs and the lines-of-code count was a <i>lot</i> lower
&mdash; it was great! Until I ran them on multi-GB files and realized they took
60x as long to complete.  So I couldn&rsquo;t write Miller in Ruby, or in
languages like it. I was going to have to do something in a low-level language
in order to make it performant. I did simple experiments in several languages,
and nothing was as fast as C, so I used C: see also <a
href="whyc.html#C_vs._Go,_D,_Rust,_etc.;_C_is_fast">here</a>.

<p/> Fifth thing: I wanted Miller to be <boldmaroon>pipe-friendly and
interoperate with other command-line tools</boldmaroon>.  Since the basic
paradigm is ingest records, transform records, emit records &mdash; where the
input and output formats can be the same or different, and the transform can be
complex, or just pass-through &mdash; this means you can use it to transform
data, or re-format it, or both. So if you just want to do
data-cleaning/prep/formatting and do all the "real" work in R, you can. If you
just want a little glue script between other tools you can get that. And if you
want to do non-trivial data-reduction in Miller you can.

<p/> Sixth thing: Must have <boldmaroon>comprehensive documentation and
unit-test</boldmaroon>. Since Miller handles a lot of formats and solves a lot
of problems, there&rsquo;s a lot to test and a lot to keep working correctly as
I add features or optimize. And I wanted it to be able to explain itself
&mdash; not only through web docs like the one you&rsquo;re reading but also
through <code>man mlr</code> and <code>mlr --help</code>, <code>mlr sort --help</code>,
etc.

<p/> Seventh thing: <boldmaroon>Must have a domain-specific
language</boldmaroon> (DSL) <boldmaroon>but also must let you do common things
without it</boldmaroon>. All those little verbs Miller has to help you
<i>avoid</i> having to write for-loops are great. I use them for
keystroke-saving: <code>mlr stats1 -a mean,stddev,min,max -f quantity</code>, for
example, without you having to write for-loops or define accumulator variables.
But you also have to be able to break out of that and write arbitrary code when
you want to: <code>mlr put '$distance = $rate * $time'</code> or anything else you
can think up. In Perl/AWK/etc.  it&rsquo;s all DSL. In xsv et al.  it&rsquo;s
all verbs. In Miller I like having the combination.

<p/> Eighth thing: It&rsquo;s an <boldmaroon>awful lot of fun to
write</boldmaroon>. In my experience I didn&rsquo;t find any tools which do
multi-format, streaming, efficient, multi-purpose, with DSL and non-DSL, so I
wrote one. But I don&rsquo;t guarantee it&rsquo;s unique in the world. It fills
a niche in the world (people use it) but it also fills a niche in my life.

<a id="Tradeoffs"/><h1>Tradeoffs</h1>
<button style="font-weight:bold;color:maroon;border:0" padding=0 onclick="vis_toggle_by_name('body_section_toggle_tradeoffs');" href="javascript:;">Toggle section visibility</button>
<div id="body_section_toggle_tradeoffs" style="display: block">

<p/> Miller is command-line-only by design. People who want a graphical user
interface won&rsquo;t find it here.  This is in part (a) accommodating my
personal preferences, and in part (b) guided by my experience/belief that the
command line is very expressive. Steep learning curve, yes. I consider that
price worth paying.

<p/> Another tradeoff: supporting lists of records &mdash; each with only one
depth &mdash; keeps me supporting only what can be expressed in <i>all</i> of
those formats.  E.g. in JSON you can have lists of lists of lists which Miller
just doesn&rsquo;t handle. So Miller can&rsquo;t (and won&rsquo;t) handle
arbitrary JSON because it only handles tabular data which can be expressed in a
variety of formats.

<p/> A third tradeoff is doing build-from-scratch in a low-level language.
It&rsquo;d be quicker to write (but slower to run) if written in a high-level
language. If Miller were written in Python, it would be implemented in
significantly fewer lines of code than its current C implementation. The DSL
would just be an <code>eval</code> of Python code. And it would run slower, but
maybe not enough slower to be a problem for most folks. Later I found out about
the <a href="https://github.com/turicas/rows">rows</a> tool &mdash; if you find
Miller useful, you should check out <code>rows</code> as well.

<p/> A fourth tradeoff is in the DSL (more visibly so in 5.0.0 but already in
pre-5.0.0): how much to make it dynamically typed &mdash; so you can just say
y=x+1 with a minimum number of keystrokes &mdash; vs. having it do a good job
of telling you when you&rsquo;ve made a typo. This is a common paradigm across
<i>all</i> languages.  Some like Ruby you don&rsquo;t declare anything and
they&rsquo;re quick to code little stuff in but programs of even a few thousand
lines (which isn&rsquo;t large in the software world) become insanely
unmanageable.  Then Java at the other extreme which is very typesafe but you
have to type in a lot of punctuation, angle brackets, datatypes, repetition,
etc. just to be able to get anything done. And some in the middle like Go which
are typesafe but with type inference which aim to do the best of both. In the
Miller (5.0.0) DSL you get y=x+1 by default but you can have things like int y
= x+1 etc. so the typesafety is opt-in. See also <a
href="reference-dsl.html#Type-checking">here</a> for more information on
type-checking.

<p/> I originally aimed Miller at people who already know what
<code>sed</code>/<code>awk</code>/<code>cut</code>/<code>sort</code>/<code>join</code> are and
wanted some options. But as time goes by I realize that tools like this can be
useful to folks who <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know what those things are; people who
aren&rsquo;t primarily coders; people who are scientists, or data scientists.
These days some journalists do data analysis.  So moving forward in terms of
docs, I am working on having more cookbook, follow-by-example stuff in addition
to the existing language-reference kinds of stuff.  And continuing to seek out
input from people who use Miller on where to go next.
