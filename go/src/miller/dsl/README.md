* `src/miller/dsl` contains `ast.go` which is the abstract syntax tree datatype shared between GOCC and Miller. I didn't use a `src/miller/dsl/ast` naming convention, although that would have been nice, in order to avoid a Go package-dependency cycle.
* `src/miller/dsl/cst` is the concrete syntax tree, constructed from an AST produced by GOCC. The CST is what is actually executed on every input record when you do things like `$z = $x * 0.3 * $y`. Please see the `README.md` in `src/miller/dsl/cst` for more information.
