BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES:

* mlr: filter expressions must end in a final boolean statement.
-> abandon this requirement? doc if so.
* mlr --from s --opprint filter '$u=1; NR > 3; $v=2'
* mlr --from s --opprint put    '$u=1; NR > 3; $v=2' <---- make sure this does NOT filter, though

rrv ./reg-test/cases/case-c-label.sh
* handles old/new clashes differently from C impl :^/
