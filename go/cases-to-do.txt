BUG:

rrv ./reg-test/cases/case-c-dsl-mapvar-assignments.sh
* probably buggy in the C impl

rrv ./reg-test/cases/case-c-dsl-forbind-typedecl.sh
rrv ./reg-test/cases/case-c-dsl-localvar-typedecl.sh
rrv ./reg-test/cases/case-c-dsl-local-map-variable-typedecl.sh
rrv ./reg-test/cases/case-c-dsl-argpass-typedecl.sh
* str s = "a"; s = 3 doesn't trigger -- needs gate-retention ...

rrv ./reg-test/cases/case-c-dsl-triple-for-loops.sh
* Needs to do this:
  "Continuation statements are split into the final boolean, and the statements before (if any)."

================================================================
LF/CRLF ETC.

================================================================
PUT -a

rrv -C20 ./reg-test/cases/case-c-dsl-local-map-variable-write-read.sh
* put -a

BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES:

rrv ./reg-test/cases/case-c-label.sh
* handles old/new clashes differently from C impl :^/

rrv ./reg-test/cases/case-c-dsl-substr.sh
* format-strings? gah. needs smart fmtnum regardless.
