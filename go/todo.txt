* lots of trivial things are just a matter of keystroking
* defer them while focusing on what's hard (and maybe most worthwhile about the Go port)

harder / more worthy:
* streaming JSON reader
* streaming RFC-compliant CSV reader
* sort
* stats1
* DSL
* calendar/DST/TZ

easier:
* most of the verbs
* most of the file formats
* then-chaining
