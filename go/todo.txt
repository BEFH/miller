* parser-fu:
  o iterative LALR grok
    - jackson notes
    - gocc .txt/.go for simple grammars
  o find/bookmark/grok rob's lexer slides
  o iterate on a parser-generator with JSON config file
    no need to bootstrap a parser for the parser-generator language
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

! ASV/USV as csvlite input; needs a csvlite record-writer
! allow ragged csv input

! csv het input
  o golang csv-reader blank-line issue ...
  ? maybe support this only in csvlite?

* justWroteEmptyLine -> pprint too ...

! JSON null needs to be passed through as-is ... somehow ... new mlrval type??
  o note json types: string, number, boolean, null, object, array.

! for-multi

! nidx @ 10-min
! text-put @ 10-min

* parex -> separate file; more ast.go splitups

! smart fmtnum w/ state-machine on chars, and casts, etc -- decouple from raw sprintf
  o use:
    - %
    - 0 - " " + "'"
    - number for min field width
    - "." and precision width
    - s   d i o u x X   e E f F g G
    - "%%"
  o need a parser for validity, and a mapper to Go-builtin formats
  o need to pull out the printed type & use that for casting/ignoring. examples:
    - %d int: ok
    - %d float: int(x) then ok
    - %d string: convert to %s
    - %f int: float(x) thenok
    - %f float: as is
    - %f string: convert to %s
    - %s int: convert to %d
    - %s float: convert to %f
    - %s string: ok

! smarter head-stop etc https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/291
  o done-reading back-channels in stream.go
    https://gobyexample.com/non-blocking-channel-operations

  o double-check $-anything in begin/end
  o regexes & associated functions -- necessary or not?
  o mlr_expect_fail extraneous check output; wut
  o ENV

  https://iridakos.com/programming/2018/03/01/bash-programmable-completion-tutorial#:~:text=Bash%20completion%20is%20a%20functionality,key%20while%20typing%20a%20command.

!! [[]] etc to avoid inadvertent sequentials for int indices on maps.
  this should happen intentionally, not accidentally.
* Check for "Options:" in all mappers
* check for `f.Value` reassigned in all mappers -- reflects true default?
* UDS

* more copy-on-retain for concurrent pointer-mods !
  o make a thorough audit, and warn everywhere
  o either do copy for all retainers, or treat inrecs as immutable ...

* sliding-window averages into mapper step (C + Go)
* stats1 rank

* some more verbs
  o easies first
  o having-fields -x feature ... or something
  o join, stats1, stats2

* double-check rand-seeding
  o all rand invocations should go through the seeder for UT/other determinism

* comment-handling
  - delegator for CSV ...

! quoted NIDX
  - how with whitespace regex -- ?
! quoted DKVP
  - what about csvlite-style -- ? needs a --dkvplite ?

* clean up 'mlr --help' to not advertise things it doesn't do yet

* ASV? golang csv package parameterizes comma but not crlf :(

* mlr -f / -F
  o others in mlrcli_parse.go
  o copy over all operator help-strings from ../c

* $map.attr1.attr2 syntax for DSL -- ? needs override of "." operator w/ symbols ... ?

* widen DSL coverage
  ! print/dump/emit w/ redirect options
  o c/reg_test/run reorgs
  o err-return for array/map get/put if incorrect types ... currently go-void ...
    ! the DSL needs a full, written-down-and-published spell-out of error-eval semantics
  o typed localvars
  o for-knv
  o profile mand.mlr & check for need for idx-assign
    -> most definitely needed

    - array destructure at LHS for multi-retval assign (maps too?)

* beyond:
  o support 'x[1]["a"]' etc notation in various verbs?
  o sort within nested data structures?
  o array-sort, map-key sort, map-value sort in the DSL?
  o closures for sorting and more -- ?!?

----------------------------------------------------------------
MAYBE:

* string index/slice access
* string/array slices on assignment LHS -- ?
* push/pop/shift/unshift subroutines

----------------------------------------------------------------
GOCC UPSTREAMS:

* support "abc" (not just 'a' 'b' 'c') in the lexer part

----------------------------------------------------------------
DEV NOTES:

* build-dsl
* build
* fmter
* check
* git diff to see what changed
* commit

----------------------------------------------------------------
PARSER/LEXER PLAN:

* grok ch27
* grok pike-lexer slides
* dragon at ... what level ?

----------------------------------------------------------------
NITS/NON-IMMEDIATE:

* "Miller: " prefixes on all errors.New
* libify errors.New callsites for DSL/CST
* record-readers are fully in-channel/loop; record-writers are multi with in-channel/loop being
  done by ChannelWriter, which is very small. opportunity to refactor.
* address all manner of xxx and TODO comments
* throughout -- 'map' used too much -- 'mapping/mapper' -> 'transform' or something?
* AST insertions: make a simple NodeFromToken & have all interface{} be *ASTNode, not *token.Token
* mlr --help-for w/ stdout redirect for manpage -- ?
* mlr verb -h -> stdout & exit 0
* cst printer with reflect.TypeOf -- ?
* godoc ...
* mlrdoc false && 4, true || 4 because of short-circuiting requirement
* update whyc.html with efficiency notes from go/README.md
? makefile for build-dsl: if $bnf newer than productionstable.go
* I/O perf delta between C & Go is smaller for CSV, middle for DKVP, large for JSON -- debug
* neaten/error-proof:
  o mlrmapEntry -> own keys/mlrvals -- keep the kcopy/vcopy & be very clear,
    or remove. (keeping pointers allows nil-check which is good.)
  o inrec *types.Mlrmap is good for default no-copy across channels ... needs
    a big red flag though for things like the repeat verb (maybe *only* that one ...)
! clean up the AST API. ish! :^/
* defer reg_test/run until there is quite a bit more verb/dsl/io expansion
* doc: no boolish truthy falsy
* json:
  d thorough UT for json mlrval-parser including various expect-fail error cases
  d doc re no jlistwrap on input if they want get streaming input
  d UT JSON-to-JSON cat-mapping should be identical
  d JSON-like accessor syntax in the grammar: $field[3]["bar"]
  d flatten/unflatten for non-JSON I/O formats -- maybe just double-quoted JSON strings -- ?
    - make a force-single-line writer
    - make a jsonparse DSL function -- ?
  d other formats: use JSON marshaler for collection types, maybe double-quoted
  o research gocc support
  o maybe a case for hand-roll
* ICE on scan of 0xffffffffffffffff
* support 0b0101 et al.? mlrdoc if so
? dsl/ast.go -> parsing/ast.go? then, put new-ast ctor -> parsing package
  o if so, update r.mds
* keep or get rid of $[[[ ]]] ... ?
* 1-up note from mlrval_collections -> doc6
  o substr -- not backward-compatible
  o example of key-stringify to get truly awkish associative-array behavior
  o also $1 vs $[1] -- the former 'sticks' with input-data ordering.
  o moral: miller is a name-indexed tool as its primary purpose. positional
    indexing is supported but it can be confusing.
* mlrdoc: there should have always been a >>> and >>>=, and now there are
! systime printing out in scientific notation :(
! head early-out -- cite the relevant issue & fix the right way ...
* relnotes: label b,i,x vs x,i,b change
* put -- multiple -f? as in C impl?
* emit { int : string } results in absent-something :^/
* doc note 'array' is now a keyword
* dump is now redundant? print @*
* double-check dump CR-terminators depending on expression type
* doc nullish-coalesece, along with its precedence
* ordering of builtin functions in mlr -f output ........
  ? primarily by type, secondarily by name?
* CST validators: remove references to bare-boolean last statement in main block
  - this is a feature
* good example of wording for why/when to make a breaking release:
  https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/
* unset, unassign, remove -- too many different names. also assign/put ... maybe stick w/ 2?
* make truncate() UTF8-friendly
* (absent) print on dump -- should simply be empty
* document array-unset as shiftback
! error if UDF has same name as built-in
* huge commenting pass
* profile mlr sort
* go exe 17MB, wut. try to discover. (gocc presumably but verify.)
* fill-down make columns required. also, --all.
* check triple-dash at mlr fill-down-h ; check others
* doc that multi-arg print interleaves spaces; they can strcat to avoid
* clean up unused exitCode arg in sort/put usage.
  o also document pre/post conditions for flag and non-flag usages x all mappers
* need to fix up ;; and start-with-; handling in the grammar so multiple put -f/-e work right :^/
? emit @x or emit x -- should make k/v pairs w/ "x" & value -- ? check against C impl
* doc one-variable for is over keys for maps, elements for arrays
* asserting_{type}: os.Exit(1) -> return nil, err flow?
* test put/filter w/ various combinations of -s/-e/-f
* math operators on map? array? e.g. a<b for contains? (prefer functions ...)
* more text examples in mlr-put doc
* mt_void keep-or-not .......
  o check dispo matrices
  o if keep, need careful MT_VOID at from-string constructor -- ? or not ?
  o comment clearly regardless
* window.mlr, window2.mlr -> doc somewhere
* bitwise_and_dispositions et al should not have _absn for collections -- _erro instead
* fmtnum: auto-replace %l_, %ll_ -> no l/ll for backwards compatibility, and comment accordingly
* mlrdoc for new go-only verbs
* ast-parex separate mlr auxents entrypoint?
* port u/window*.mlr from mlrc to mlrgo (actually, fix mlrgo of course)
* doc: substr in inferred-numeric fields: https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/290.
  o xref to 1-up note.
* why error? mlr put '$y=true; $y &= $x<0.5' s
* line/column caret at parse-error messages -- would require some GOCC refactoring
  in order to get the full DSL string and the line/number info into the same method
