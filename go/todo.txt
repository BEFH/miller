* lots of trivial things are just a matter of keystroking
* defer them while focusing on what's hard (and maybe most worthwhile about the Go port)

harder / more worthy:
~ streaming JSON reader
  -> w/ and w/o enclosing [...] !
~ streaming RFC-compliant CSV reader
* sort
* stats1
* calendar/DST/TZ
! DSL

easier:
* most of the verbs
* most of the file formats
* then-chaining

long-term:
* srecs as string -> mlrvals, then mlrval | mlhmmv
* support full json read/write
  o only requirement is that top-level be sequence of string-valued objects ...
  o json-to-json cat-mapping should be identical
  o json-like accessor syntax in the grammar: $field.foo[3].bar{"bar"}
