* lots of trivial things are just a matter of keystroking
* defer them while focusing on what's hard (and maybe most worthwhile about the Go port)

harder / more worthy:
~ streaming JSON reader
  -> w/ and w/o enclosing [...] !
~ streaming RFC-compliant CSV reader
* sort
* stats1
* calendar/DST/TZ
! DSL

easier:
* most of the verbs
* most of the file formats
* then-chaining
